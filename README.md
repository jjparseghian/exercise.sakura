Cherry blossom tree built with OOjs, HTML5 Canvas and Turtle Graphics.

The tree represents a recursive structure as a collection of objects and is the expression of two simple rules: (1) branches grow, and (2)
branches branch. It's a [fractal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal)â€”an
image that contains instances of itself.
